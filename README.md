## Project Description
- The Mental Health Chatbot is a tool designed to assist in identifying potential mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression based on users' inputs. The chatbot leverages advanced machine learning models and embeddings to analyze text data and provide relevant feedback.

## Features
1. Natural Language Processing: Users can interact with the chatbot using natural language.
2. Mental Health Detection: The chatbot evaluates the user's input to detect signs of mental health issues.
3. Advanced Models: Utilizes Google Palm's text-bison model and HuggingFace's Instructor Embeddings for accurate analysis.
4. Vector Database: Uses FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient similarity search and retrieval of context.
5. Streamlit Interface: Provides an easy-to-use web interface for user interaction.
